      <description>A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system. Think of sequences of numbers, or tables of data: these are both well-defined data structures. An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output.
Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like. Deep study into data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.</description>
